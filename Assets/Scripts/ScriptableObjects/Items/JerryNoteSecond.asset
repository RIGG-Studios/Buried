  text: I've been hearing voices behind this door for the past few days. Today I
    had enough of it and decided to try entering when Tom and Jack were away. Surprisingly
    it worked. This place has a lot of relics from what appears to be a lost civilization.
    However, no matter how hard I try, I am unable to enter the room to the right.
