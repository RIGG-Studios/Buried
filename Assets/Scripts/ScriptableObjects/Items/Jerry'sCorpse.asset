  name: A strange corpse
  text: 'This is a very emaciated corpse, looks like it died of starvation, but it''s
    missing large chunks of its body, almost as if it was partially eaten.. The corpse
    also appears to have razor sharp teeth stained with old blood and long black
    claws.


    It appears to be desperately reaching for something.'
