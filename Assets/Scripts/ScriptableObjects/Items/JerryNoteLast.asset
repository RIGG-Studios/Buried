  name: I'm so so so sorry
  text: "Oh god, what have I done? I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, I couldn't control
    myself, the hunger is so powerful...\n\nMy strength is fading quickly. My vision's
    going blurry, I need to eat some more...\n\nIf anyone finds this, please leave
    this place as soon as you can! There's something supernatural here, something
    we were never meant to find. \n\nI will try to kill myself and take this whole
    place with me, it's the least I can do to make amends with Tom and Jack."
