  text: Today has been a good day, we just arrived at camp and begun stashing away
    out things in the chests, we couldn't get the crates open so they remain empty.
    However, there's also a strange door in camp. None of us are sure how to open
    it, it seems impervious to all forms of damage... It's very strange, we will
    need to ask our contractors about this
